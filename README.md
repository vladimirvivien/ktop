A `top`-like tool for your Kubernetes cluster.

Following the tradition of Unix/Linux `top` tools, `ktop` is a tool that displays useful metrics information about nodes, pods, and other workload resources running in a Kubernetes cluster.

## Features

* Insightful summary of cluster resource metrics
* Ability to work with or without a metrics-server deployed
* Displays nodes and pods usage metrics when a Metrics Server is found
* Uses your existing cluster configuration to connect to a cluster's API server

## Installing ktop

### kubectl `ktop` plugin

Project `ktop` is distributed as a kubectl plugin.  To use ktop as a plugin do the followings:

* [Install](https://krew.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user-guide/setup/install/) `krew` plugin manager (if not present)
* Ensure ktop is available to be installed: `kubectl krew search ktop`
* Next, install the plugin: `kubectl krew install ktop`

Once installed, start the ktop plugin with

```
kubectl ktop
```

### Homebrew installation
`ktop` is also available via the `brew` package manager. 

#### OSX / Linux

```
brew tap vladimirvivien/oss-tools
brew install ktop
```

### Using a container
The binary is relased as an OCI container at `ghcr.io/vladimirvivien/ktop`.
If you have a container runtime installed (Docker for instance), you launch ktop as shown below:

```
export KUBECONFIG=/home/user/.kube/config
docker run --network=host --rm --platform="linux/arm64" -it -v $KUBECONFIG:/config -e KUBECONFIG=/config -e TERM=xterm-256color ghcr.io/vladimirvivien/ktop:latest
```

### Using `go install`

If you have a recent version of Go installed (1.14 or later) you can build and install ktop as follows:

```
go install github.com/vladimirvivien/ktop@latest
```

This should place the ktop binary in your configured `$GOBIN` path or place it in its default location, `$HOME/go/bin`.

### Download binary

Another easy way to get started with ktop is to download the pre-built binary directly (for your system):

> https://github.com/vladimirvivien/ktop/releases/latest

Then, extract the ktop binary and copy it to your system's execution path.


### Build from source

Download or clone the source (from GitHub). From the project's root directory, do the following:

```
go build .
```

The project also comes with a Go program that you can use for cross-platform builds.
```
go run ./ci/build.go
```

## Running ktop

With a locally accessible kubeconfig file on your machine, ktop can be executed simply:

```
ktop
```

The previous command will use either environment variable `$KUBECONFIG` or the default path for the kubeconfig file. The program currently accepts the following arguments:

```
Usage:
  ktop [flags]

Flags:
  -A, --all-namespaces                 If true, display metrics for all accessible namespaces
      --as string                      Username to impersonate for the operation. User could be a regular user or a service account in a namespace.
      --as-group stringArray           Group to impersonate for the operation, this flag can be repeated to specify multiple groups.
      --as-uid string                  UID to impersonate for the operation.
      --cache-dir string               Default cache directory (default "${HOME}/.kube/cache")
      --certificate-authority string   Path to a cert file for the certificate authority
      --client-certificate string      Path to a client certificate file for TLS
      --client-key string              Path to a client key file for TLS
      --cluster string                 The name of the kubeconfig cluster to use
      --context string                 The name of the kubeconfig context to use
  -h, --help                           help for ktop
      --insecure-skip-tls-verify       If true, the server's certificate will not be checked for validity. This will make your HTTPS connections insecure
      --kubeconfig string              Path to the kubeconfig file to use for CLI requests.
  -n, --namespace string               If present, the namespace scope for this CLI request
      --node-columns string            Comma-separated list of node columns to display (e.g. 'NAME,CPU,MEM')
      --pod-columns string             Comma-separated list of pod columns to display (e.g. 'NAMESPACE,POD,STATUS')
      --request-timeout string         The length of time to wait before giving up on a single server request. Non-zero values should contain a corresponding time unit (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). A value of zero means don't timeout requests. (default "0")
  -s, --server string                  The address and port of the Kubernetes API server
      --show-all-columns               If true, show all columns (default true)
      --tls-server-name string         Server name to use for server certificate validation. If it is not provided, the hostname used to contact the server is used
      --token string                   Bearer token for authentication to the API server
      --user string                    The name of the kubeconfig user to use
```

For instance, the following will show cluster information for workload resources associated with namespace `my-app` in context `web-cluster` using the default kubconfig file path:

```
ktop --namespace my-app --context web-cluster
```

### Column Filtering

You can customize which columns are displayed in the nodes and pods tables. This is useful when you want to focus on specific metrics or when working with limited screen space.

To show only specific node columns:

```
ktop --node-columns NAME,CPU,MEM
```

To show only specific pod columns:

```
ktop --pod-columns NAMESPACE,POD,CPU,MEMORY
```

You can combine both filters:

```
ktop --node-columns NAME,CPU,MEM --pod-columns NAMESPACE,POD,STATUS
```

Available node columns:
- NAME
- STATUS
- AGE
- VERSION
- INT/EXT IPs
- OS/ARC
- PODS/IMGs
- DISK
- CPU
- MEM

Available pod columns:
- NAMESPACE
- POD
- READY
- STATUS
- RESTARTS
- AGE
- VOLS
- IP
- NODE
- CPU
- MEMORY

## ktop metrics

The ktop UI provides several metrics including a high-level summary of workload components installed on your cluster:

</h1>

### Usage metrics from `metrics-server`

ktop can display metrics with or without Metrics Server present.  When a cluster has an instance of a [kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/metrics-server) installed (and properly configured), ktop will automatically discover the server as shown:

<h1 align="center">
    <img src="./docs/ktop-metrics-connected.png" alt="ktop">
</h1>

With the metrics server installed, ktop will display resource utilization metrics as reported by the Metrics Server.

### Request/limit metrics

When there is no Metrics Server present in the cluster, ktop will still work:

<h1 align="center">
    <img src="./docs/ktop-metrics-not-connected.png" alt="ktop">
</h1>

Instead of resource utilization, ktop will display resource requests and limits for nodes and pods.

## Known issue
For ktop to work properly, the user account that is used (from the Kubernetes config) must have access rights to the following API objects, and their metrics: 

* Nodes (and metrics)
* Pods (and metrics)
* Deployments,
* PV, PVCs
* {Replica|Daemon|Stateful}Sets
* Jobs


When your Kubernetes user account does not have proper access rights,  you will see warning printed on the terminal, similar to the followings:

```

```

### What to do

`ktop` supports many additional CLI arguments to help you connect properly. You can set the following
arguments to adjust your connection parameters:

* `--context` - context for cluster
* `--user` - a user with proper access rights
* `--as-{uid/group}` - if impersonating a different account

There are many other arguments that may be configured to create a successful connection to the API server.
See the full list of CLI arguments in the *Running ktop* section above.

## Roadmap

* A multi-page UI to display metrics for additional components
* Display OOM processes
* Additional installation methods (Homebrew, linux packages, etc)
* Etc
